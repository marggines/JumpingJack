INSTRUCTIONS: (Original manual)


Jack can only move upwards by jumping through the gap above but he can also
move left and right. Should he run off the edge of the screen he will wrap
around to the other edge. Should he fall down a layer he will bang his head
and remain unconscious for a period of time during which he cannot move.
Every time he arrives at the bottom of the screen unconscious he loses a
life. At each successful jump a new gap appears at random - the first three
new gaps descend then the next three ascend - up to a maximum of eight gaps.
On making a successful jump at the top layer the 'next level' sequence is
entered.


FACILITIES:

    On level zero you can see the reflections of  hazards sprites that move on level 7.
    Also on line 0 you can see reflections of gaps in line 8.
    You don't  have to start the game from Level 0 - you can choose the one you want.

COMPETITIONS:

    SCORE - Get the most points (each level starts counting from 0).
    TIME - Time to complete the stage.
    FAILS - Number of collisions with the hazard.
    HITS - Numer of enemies shot down (EXTENDED MODE)
    

The game has been tested and it is possible to complete all levels on speed 2(default). I don't know about other speeds.
The difficulty level has been adjusted to make the game fun.
